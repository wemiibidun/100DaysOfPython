'''
The aim of this project is to suggest a name for your name by asking you two questions.
On this project, I learnt how to name and create variables, concantenation and using the input function
'''

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city_name = input("What is the name of the city that you grew up in?\n")

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet_name = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be "+ city_name + " " + pet_name)
